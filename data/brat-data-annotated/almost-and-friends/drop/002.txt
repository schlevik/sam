Paragraph:

[aug] yes no [text] Hoping to rebound from their tough loss to the Giants, the Redskins traveled to Heinz Field to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers, and attempted to improve to 1-1 against the AFC. The Steelers marched straight down the field on Washington's defense, culminating in a fourth-and-goal 1-yard touchdown pass to backup tight end Leonard Pope from Ben Roethlisberger to give the Steelers a 7-0 lead. Following a Washington three-and-out, the Steelers got the ball back, this time scoring by way of former despised Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham nailing a 48-yard field goal to extend the Steelers' advantage to 10-0. In the second, Washington was able to get on the board as quarterback Robert Griffin III found Santana Moss to cut into Pittsburgh's advantage 10-6. It would have been 10-7, but Kai Forbath's extra point was blocked. Pittsburgh responded with a Heath Miller 7-yard touchdown and a Suisham 27-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh a 20-6 lead at the half. In the third, Washington drew to 20-9 on a Forbath 48-yard field goal, but Pittsburgh nearly put the game away with a Will Johnson 1-yard touchdown catch to give Pittsburgh a 27-9 lead late in the third. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally as Forbath connected again, this time from 45 yards, but Washington could not score again, as a myriad of dropped passes and a turnover on downs with just over four minutes remaining sealed their fate, as the final score remained 27-12. With the loss, Washington fell to 3-5, and 0-2 against the AFC. Washington has now lost 6 straight games to AFC opponents and has not beaten an AFC team since Week 16 of the 2010 season. During the game, DeAngelo Hall was ejected from the game after using profanity at the officials and was given a fine by the NFL.
