[aug] yes no [title] Boeing 707 [text] The Boeing 707 is a mid-sized, long-range, narrow-body, four-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 1958 to 1979. Its name is commonly pronounced as "seven oh seven". Versions of the aircraft have a capacity from 140 to 219 passengers and a range of 2500 to . [title] Keyway Air Transport [text] Keyway Air Transport was a United States airline that operated from Frankfurt International Airport (which at the time was also home to a United States Air Force facility; Rhein-Main Air Base) using a Boeing T-43 Bobcat (a military variant of the Boeing 737-200) and a Boeing 707-355C. Details on its operation are unknown. The 737-200 was operated by Keyway Air Transport from 1986 up until 1992, when it was transferred to defence contractor EG&G, who operated the aircraft in the Janet fleet up until 2009 when it was retired from service. The Boeing 707-355C was operated from 1986 up until 1989, when it was transferred to HCL Aviation. From 1992 onwards, after having been modified for military service by Raytheon, the aircraft was used by the United States Air Force as an airborne command post for the United States Central Command and later on was reported as being used by the Air Force Special Operations Command, before being put in storage at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group located on Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in 2002. [title] 1703d Air Transport Group [text] The 1703d Air Transport Group is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was assigned to Military Air Transport Service (MATS) at Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama. It was inactivated on 18 June 1957. The group was formed in 1948 as the 521st Air Transport Group when MATS replaced Air Transport Command and converted its units to the Wing Base organization system. [title] BAC One-Eleven [text] The British Aircraft Corporation One-Eleven, also known as the BAC-111 or BAC 1-11, was a British short-range jet airliner used during the 1960s and 1970s. It was the second short-haul jet airliner to enter service, following the French Sud Aviation Caravelle. The aircraft was also produced under license in Romania during the 1980s as the Rombac One-Eleven. [title] Hunting-Clan Air Transport [text] Hunting-Clan Air Transport was a wholly private, British independent airline that was founded in the immediate post-World War II period. It began trading on January 1, 1946 as Hunting Air Travel Ltd. It was a subsidiary of the Hunting Group of companies, which had come from the shipping industry and could trace its history back to the 19th century. The newly formed airline's first operating base was at Bovingdon Airport in Southeast England. Its main activities were contract, scheduled and non-scheduled domestic and international air services that were initially operated with Douglas Dakota and Vickers Viking piston airliners from the company's Bovingdon base. A change of name to Hunting Air Transport occurred in 1951. By that time, the airline had emerged as one of the healthiest and most securely financed independent airlines in Britain. In October 1953, the firm's name changed to Hunting-Clan Air Transport, as a result of an agreement between the Hunting Group and the Clan Line group of companies to invest £500,000 each in a new company named Hunting-Clan Air Holdings Ltd, the holding company for the combined group's air transport interests. Apart from Hunting-Clan Air Transport itself, this included Field Aircraft Services Ltd, the Hunting group's aircraft maintenance arm. In 1960, Hunting-Clan Air Transport merged with the Airwork group to form British United Airways (BUA). [title] Operation Safe Haven (1957) [text] Operation Safe Haven was a refugee relocation operation executed by the United States Marine Corps to evacuate 15,570-21,000 of the 200,000 Hungarian refugees to the United States following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The airlift was ordered by Dwight D. Eisenhower on Dec. 10, 1956, as a Cold War response to the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revolt. It was a joint endeavor by the United States Bolling and Military Air Transport Services, the United States Navy, and various commercial aircraft. On January 1, 1957, air transports from the 1608th Air Transport Wing from Charleston Air Force Base, S.C., and 175 aircraft from the 1611th Air Transport Wing from McGuire AFB, N.J., relocated 9,700 refugees to the United States, under the direction of Airlift Task Force commander Major General George B. Dany. In addition to air transport, from December 18, 1956, through February 14, 1957, ships of the Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service (USNS Eltinge, Haan, Marine Carp, and Walker) transported 8,944 refugees from Bremerhaven, Germany, to New York City, USA. These refugees were job-classified by the U.S. Labor Department as they made their way to American shores. [title] Hawker Siddeley Andover [text] The Hawker Siddeley HS 780 Andover is a twin-engined turboprop military transport aircraft produced by Hawker Siddeley for the Royal Air Force developed from the Avro-designed HS 748 airliner. The Andover was named after the Avro Andover, a Royal Air Force (RAF) biplane transport used for medical evacuation between the first and second world wars; and RAF Andover, where trials of the aircraft were partially carried out. The Andover had a kneeling landing gear to make ramp loading easier. [title] Avro Canada C102 Jetliner [text] The Avro C102 Jetliner was a Canadian prototype medium-range turbojet-powered jet airliner built by Avro Canada in 1949. It was beaten to the air by only 13 days by the de Havilland Comet, thereby becoming the second jet airliner in the world. The name "Jetliner" was chosen as a shortening of the term "jet airliner", a term which is still in popular usage in Canada and the United States. The aircraft was considered suitable for busy routes along the US eastern seaboard and garnered intense interest, notably from Howard Hughes who even offered to start production under license. However continued delays in Avro's all-weather interceptor project, the Avro CF-100, led to an order to stop working on the project in 1951, with the prototype Jetliner later cut up for scrap. [title] Tupolev Tu-104 [text] The Tupolev Tu-104 (NATO reporting name: Camel) was a twin-engined medium-range narrow-body turbojet-powered Soviet airliner and the world's first successful jet airliner. Although it was the sixth jet airliner to fly (following, in order, the British Vickers Type 618 Nene-Viking, de Havilland Comet, Canadian Avro Canada C102 Jetliner, US Boeing 367-80 and French Sud Caravelle), the Tu-104 was the second to enter regular service (with Aeroflot) and the first to provide a sustained and successful service (the Comet which had entered service in 1952, was withdrawn from 1954-1958 following a series of crashes due to structural failure). The Tu-104 was the sole jetliner operating in the world between 1956 and 1958. [title] Ilyushin Il-62 [text] The Ilyushin Il-62 (Russian: Илью́шин Ил-62 ; NATO reporting name: Classic) is a Soviet long-range narrow-body jet airliner conceived in 1960 by Ilyushin. As successor to the popular turbo-prop Il-18 and with capacity for almost 200 passengers and crew, the Il-62 was the world's largest jet airliner when first flown in 1963. Being one of four pioneering long-range designs (the others being Boeing 707, DC-8, and VC10), it was the first such type to be operated by the Soviet Union and a number of allied nations. The Il-62 entered Aeroflot civilian service on 15 September 1967 with an inaugural passenger flight from Moscow to Montreal, and remained the standard long-range airliner for the Soviet Union (and later, Russia) for several decades. It was the first Russian pressurised aircraft with non-circular cross-section fuselage and ergonomic passenger doors, and the first Russian jet with six-abreast seating (the turbo-prop Tu-114 shared this arrangement) and international-standard position lights.
