[aug] yes no [text] The Redskins opened their 2012 season on the road, marking the much-anticipated debut of Robert Griffin III, the second overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. Griffin started his career as well as possible, going 6/6 on his opening possession, setting up a 37-yard field goal by new Redskins kicker Billy Cundiff. However, the lead would be short lived as Six-time Pro Bowl QB Drew Brees marched his Saints down the field, culminating in a 20-yard touchdown pass to star tight end Jimmy Graham. For the first time, Griffin's resolve was tested, as he marched onto the field trailing for the first time. Griffin was unfazed, and after not completing a pass ahead of the line of scrimmage on his first possession, Griffin connected with fellow new Redskins Pierre Gar&#231;on for an 88-yard strike to give Washington a 10-7 lead. In the second quarter, Washington's lead continued to grow, as Griffin found second-year man Aldrick Robinson for a 5-yard touchdown pass to extend Washington's advantage to 17-7. Cundiff added a 41-yard field goal to give Washington a 20-7 advantage. On the next Saints ensuing possession, Brees found Marques Colston who was on his way to an apparent touchdown, but fumbled in the Washington endzone, which resulted in a touchback. Appearing to go into the second half up 20-7, Saverio Rocca's punt was blocked and returned four yards for a touchdown by Saints special teamer Courtney Roby to make it 20-14 at the half. Getting the ball to start the second half, Washington extended its advantage by way of a 1-yard rush TD by rookie running back Alfred Morris. Washington would again expand upon its lead via Cundiff's 37-yarder, to make it 30-14 Washington. Saints kicker Garrett Hartley hit a 21-yard field goal to close the third quarter scoring at 30-17. In the fourth, Washington again pushed its advantage to 16 when Billy Cundiff nailed his fourth field goal of the day, this one from 45 yards. However, the Saints would not go quietly. On the Saints' ensuing possession, Brian Orakpo dropped an interception on 3rd and 10 that would've all but sealed the deal. With this new break, Brees made the Redskins pay, as Lance Moore beat Madieu Williams to the endzone for a 33-yard touchdown on 4th-and-10. Darren Sproles scored on the two-point conversion to cut the Redskins lead to 33-25. The Redskins could not amass a first down on their next drive, and Drew Brees got the ball back with the crowd sensing a comeback. However, Brees overthrew his intended receiver on the first play of the drive, and DeJon Gomes returned the interception to the Saints 3-yard line, and on the next play, Alfred Morris extended the advantage to 40-25. However, the Saints continued to battle. It took Brees less than one minute to march New Orleans down the field and find Darren Sproles for a 2-yard touchdown pass, and the Saints again pulled within 8. The Redskins got the ball back and were able to nearly run out the clock, but gave Brees one last chance. However, fortunately for the Redskins, Brees' Hail Mary pass on the final play of the game fell short of the intended target and was intercepted by Reed Doughty to preserve the 40-32 upset win. With the win, the Redskins began the season 1-0. Robert Griffin III became the first rookie QB to throw for 300 yards in his debut game and win the game. This was the first game in league history to end with a score of 40 to 32.
