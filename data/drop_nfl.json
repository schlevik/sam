After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game.

'04) for an NFC South match-up on Monday Night.  From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a 26-yard field goal.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an 11-yard TD on a reverse.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder) and one field goal in the third (a 20-yarder).  The Falcons would fall to 2-1, as their offense got swapped, battered, and bruised.

The Patriots opened the game with a 14-play, 78-yard drive culminating in a Gostkowski 20-yard field goal. After a 65-yard drive brought them to the Patriots' 1-yard line, the Browns failed to score on two downs before quarterback Derek Anderson threw an interception to linebacker Junior Seau on third down. Following a Patriots three-and-out, a Samuel interception on the first play of the Browns' next drive gave the Patriots the ball at the Browns' 34-yard line. Brady quickly turned the turnover into points, throwing a 34-yard touchdown pass to Stallworth to give the Patriots a 10-0 lead. The Browns would then punt on their next drive. On the first drive of the second quarter, the Patriots would move into Browns territory but were forced to punt, giving the Browns the ball at their own 12-yard line. After a 36-yard punt by Scott Player, the Patriots began their ensuing drive from their own 49-yard line. They would advance to the Browns' 4-yard line, but a Morris run for a loss forced a 25-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 13-0 lead. The Browns' next drive showed promise after Anderson moved the team from their own 10-yard line to the 46-yard line, but following the two-minute warning a false start penalty and then an interception by Seau, his second of the game, ended the advance. With good field position, Brady moved the 25 necessary yards in three plays, taking a 20-0 lead on a 7-yard Watson touchdown reception. A Bruschi sack then forced the Browns to take a knee to end the half. In the second half, both teams exchanged punts before the Browns began an 8-play, 56-yard drive that got them on the scoreboard, with Phil Dawson kicking a 42-yard field goal. Neither team could advance past midfield until the closing minutes of the quarter. The Browns would then score their first touchdown of the day, on a 21-yard strike from Anderson to wide receiver Tim Carter. The Patriots would respond with their own touchdown drive, taking a 27-10 lead on a 25-yard touchdown catch by Watson. After an exchange of punts gave the Browns the ball at the Patriots' 35-yard line, Anderson threw his second touchdown pass of the day, this one good for 14&#160;yards to tight end Kellen Winslow II to pull the Browns to within 10 points. The Patriots were able to hold the ball for the next five minutes, but could not score, with a Brady pass to Vrabel falling incomplete on fourth down from the Browns' 4-yard line. However, this meant the Browns had to begin their next drive from that spot, and on the first play, Winslow fumbled a 15-yard catch, which was recovered by Gay and returned for a touchdown. The Browns reached the Patriots' 10-yard line on the final possession of the game, but could not score, ending the game at 34-17, giving the Patriots their fifth win of the season as they improved to 5-0.

The Broncos sat atop the AFC West standings with a 5-1 record thanks in large part to a strong running game and a dominating defense that had only allowed two touchdowns on the season. Both defenses played well in the first quarter, which ended with the Colts leading 3-0. Denver took the lead early in the second quarter on a Jake Plummer one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis cut the lead to one on their next drive, which ended in a 30-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal, but the Broncos answered with a 15-yard touchdown pass from QB Jake Plummer to WR Javon Walker just before halftime to expand their lead to 14-6. On their first drive of the half Indianapolis came within one point of the lead on a 12-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne. On the Colts' next possession, Wayne and Manning hooked up again for another touchdown, this one a 5-yard TD pass to take the lead 20-14. But the Broncos came back with a one-yard touchdown run by Mike Bell, giving them a one-point lead at the end of the third quarter. After a Vinatieri field goal and another Denver touchdown, the Colts were down by 5 points with a little over half of the fourth quarter remaining. After the Colts received the kickoff, they marched down the field. The drive ended with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Wayne, the third time they hooked up for a touchdown in the game. The Colts were now up by one point and decided to go for the two-point conversion to go up by a field goal. The conversion was a success as Manning found Reggie Wayne in the end zone again. Jason Elam came through for Denver and made a 49-yard field goal to tie the game at 31. The final drive of the game resulted in an Adam Vinatieri field goal with two seconds left to put Indianapolis up by three. Manning ended the game with three touchdown passes, all of them to Reggie Wayne. Rookie RB Joseph Addai had a career-high 93 yards rushing on only 17 carries.

Two plays later DeSean Jackson took the direct snap and rushed 9-yards, diving to the pylon for a touchdown less than two minutes into the game.  Manning then led the Giants up the field and he found Plaxico Burress for a 17-yard touchdown.  The Eagles fumbled the kickoff, and New York cashed in for a field goal.  On New York's next drive, Manning capped off another long drive with a short touchdown pass to Kevin Boss to take a 17-7 lead early in the second quarter.  A fumble by Giant rusher Brandon Jacobs gave Philadelphia the ball in New York territory.  Six plays later, Donovan McNabb completed a 10-yard pass to Jason Avant for an Eagle touchdown.  Sam Madison picked off McNabb deep in Eagle territory on the next drive, but the Giants settled for a field goal to make it 20-14.  McNabb ran the two-minute drill before the half to get the Eagles a 29-yard field goal before halftime, narrowing the score to 20-17.  After a good kickoff return by rookie Quintin Demps, the Eagles navigated the short field for another touchdown, this one a fade to Hank Baskett and a 24-20 Philadelphia lead.  The Giants, continuing to have success with their ground game, drove down the field.  On a critical 3rd-and-10 from the Eagle 20-yard line, Manning completed a 17-yard pass to Boss, but was flagged for crossing the line of scrimmage.  Giants' coach Tom Coughlin challenged the call, and it was reversed, giving New York 1st-and-goal.  They scored when Jacobs powered forward on a 3-yard run.  Another long Giant drive led to a field goal early in the fourth quarter making it 30-24 Giants.  The Giants scored again on their next drive, a 3-yard rush by Jacobs.  Andy Reid challenged consecutive plays at the end of the drive, but lost both of them, leaving the Eagles with only one timeout, 9:30 left to play, and a 36-24 deficit (after New York missed on the two-point conversion).  A 32-yard completion to DeSean Jackson jump-started the offense, and McNabb hit Kevin Curtis for a 2-yard touchdown on fourth down to keep Philadelphia alive.

Jeff Joniak wrote a goal of the Bears offense would be to get into scoring position; since Mitchell Trubisky became the starter, the offense had entered the red zone only twice in three games, with both trips ending in field goals. Upon reaching the 20-yard line, using the running game would be ideal; Jordan Howard ranked fifth in the league in rushing, second in yards after contact, and led the offense rushing first downs with 32. In contrast, the Saints defense ranked 30th in rushing yards allowed per carry. Joniak also emphasized the need for Trubisky to tune out the loud Superdome crowd and lead the offense without making errors. For the defense, it faced Drew Brees, who, according to Joniak, was to be pressured quickly if the Bears were to succeed - while being blitzed, Brees was intercepted three times and sacked twice. Otherwise, Brees was successful in quickly passing the ball for gains of six yards in a fast-paced offense. Turnovers were also priority; in the last two games, the Bears had forced six and scored on three, and while Brees had recorded turnovers in his last two games, the Saints still had the fifth-best turnover difference. On the Saints' opening possession, Will Lutz was lining up for a 32-yard field goal attempt when Kyle Fuller was penalized for jumping offsides. This set up Alvin Kamara's eight-yard touchdown run to put New Orleans up by seven points. After the next two drives resulted in punts, Connor Barth made a 27-yard field goal in the second quarter, though Mark Ingram Jr. scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Barth missed a 48-yard field goal wide left late in the first half as the Bears entered halftime with an 11-point deficit. In the third quarter, Trubisky threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who landed on his knee and dislocated it in the process. The touchdown was eventually nullified when referee Carl Cheffers determined Miller had let go of the ball in pain while on the ground. The Bears were forced to settle for Barth's 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Lutz kicked a 45-yard field goal to increase the lead to 17-6. With 7:32 remaining in the game, Jonathan Bullard stripped Ingram and Christian Jones recovered the fumble. Aided by Trubisky's 46-yard run, Tarik Cohen dove into the end zone from the Saints' one-yard line to score the offense's first touchdown in 25 series (dating back to the Baltimore game). The Bears failed to score on the two-point conversion but were just five points down. Chicago forced another takeaway when Adrian Amos stripped and recovered the ball from Ingram with 2:12 left. Although the Bears turned the ball over on downs, they had another chance after Lutz's 49-yard field goal put them behind by eight points. However, Trubisky's pass for Tre McBride was intercepted by Marshon Lattimore to seal the loss. Miller was taken to the University Medical Center New Orleans for treatment. In addition to a dislocated knee, Miller was revealed to have torn the popliteal artery in his region, an injury that is common in car accidents and raised the possibility of amputation. Vascular surgery was successfully completed the day after the game. The overturning of Miller's catch was controversial. Cheffers defended the call, stating when Miller was falling to the turf, he \"has to survive the ground. He went to the ground, he temporarily lost control of the ball. The ball hit the ground; therefore it's incomplete.\" The NFL's Vice President of Officiating Alberto Riveron also maintained Miller had not completed the catch, but predecessors Mike Pereira and Dean Blandino argued otherwise. \"At some point the process of the catch ends, and it ends when he rolls over on the ground with control. It was ruled a catch on the field. I didn't see anything definitive to overturn it and quite frankly, if it had been ruled incomplete on the field, if it had been me in the command center, I would have reversed it to a catch,\" Blandino said.

In the fourth quarter, McNair put the game away with a 4-yard pass to TE Daniel Wilcox.

To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive. The Chiefs won the toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points late in the first quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17-3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs. With 7:51 left in the game and down 17-6, Cutler attempted to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with Cutler throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson in the corner of the left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler's pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. Cutler led the offense on an eight-play, 67-yard drive, concluding with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two-point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in the game. Smith reached the Bears' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine-yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66-yard field goal. However, Santos' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18-17 win. This was Chicago's first victory at Arrowhead since 1993 where the Bears won 19-17. Two team records were set during the game. After converting his second field goal of the game, Gould became the leader of the most points in franchise history with 1,168 points, surpassing Kevin Butler. The win was Cutler's 46th with the Bears, tying Jim McMahon for the most in team history.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Who scored the first touchdown of the game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}, "query_id": "eb9cd224-4836-45fc-8adc-15b4a66cdef3", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Chiefs"]}]}, {"question": "Which player attempted a 66 yard field goal?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Santos"]}, "query_id": "6915656c-d98e-4938-9e00-bdc4e967f034", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Santos"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Santos"]}]}, {"question": "What was the winning score?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["18"]}, "query_id": "dcbe63b8-be1d-465f-9efb-1bf7bbe9a59e", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["31-3"]}, {"number": "18", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "What was the losing total?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["17"]}, "query_id": "1ce4463e-39a1-4b8d-b6ca-643331827605", "validated_answers": [{"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "17", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many field goals were made in this game?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "29708a89-5223-4edd-be24-1128b7b7695b", "validated_answers": [{"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How long was the longest field goal attempt in this game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["66-yard field goal"]}, "query_id": "9012daf2-c89a-4eb0-b53e-db831f17e562", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["66-yard"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["66-yard field goal"]}]}, {"question": "How many points in total were scored?", "answer": {"number": "35", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "fbc24a20-7568-47ec-9618-5fc9dd052f23", "validated_answers": [{"number": "35", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "35", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many points did the Bears win by?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "636c2763-ba02-4db0-b2dd-a4abda571337", "validated_answers": [{"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "Who scored more points, Bears or chiefs?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, "query_id": "fca7116f-43b4-4fb3-95b9-350f39057dfa", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}]}, {"question": "Who scored the first points of the game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}, "query_id": "d52ba158-62a8-4e73-b04d-f0c69426ecf6", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Chiefs"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}]}, {"question": "Who scored the first points of the second half?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Robbie Gould"]}, "query_id": "2e8baded-df2d-4548-aced-7e80e08013ce", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}]}]}, {"passage": " Wearing bright orange uniforms and showing their speed on defense and special teams, the Chicago Bears overwhelmed the 49ers who were coming off their Bye Week. They jumped to a 24-0 first-quarter lead and 41-0 halftime cushion before coasting to a 41-10 victory. Brian Urlacher's one-handed interception was headed to the highlight reel as soon as he tumbled to the ground after somehow batting the ball to himself. Urlacher's stellar play symbolized what kind of afternoon it was for the refreshed and still unbeaten Chicago Bears - and how frustrating the day was for the San Francisco 49ers. San Francisco entered giving up 32 points a game, but the defense wasn't to fault early on because turnovers allowed the Bears to work from short fields. Drives started at the 15, 41 and 13, and they turned all three into touchdowns to take the big opening-quarter lead. The 49ers coughed up the ball a fourth time late in the half when WR Antonio Bryant caught a pass and fumbled, with CB Ricky Manning Jr. recovering. San Francisco averted a shutout in the fourth quarter on a 23-yard field goal by K Joe Nedney and a 16-yard TD pass from Smith to WR Antonio Bryant. QB Alex Smith finished 16 of 26 for 146 yards. RB Frank Gore rushed for 111 yards on 12 carries, thanks to a 53-yard run.

Pittsburgh stopped the Giants on four consecutive plays from inside the Steelers 2-yard line to force a turnover on downs. But were unable to score when two Ben Roethlisberger interceptions and a punt lead to two more field goals in the second quarter for the Giants. At 10:10 of the third quarter Roethlisberger completed a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14-9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison&#8212;who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren&#8212;snapped the ball out of the end zone to give the Giants a safety and tie the game.

linebacker Peter Sirmon that negated an interception by defensive back Reynaldo Hill, capped off by a 1-yard touchdown run from Kevan Barlow. After another Titans punt, Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher grew impatient with starting quarterback Kerry Collins, pulling him in favor of rookie quarterback Vince Young. Young drove the Titans to the Jets' 32-yard line, but underthrew receiver David Givens on the next play, and Andre Dyson intercepted. Pennington drove the Jets into the Titans' red zone, completing a 10-yard pass to Sean Ryan, but Ryan was hit hard by Keith Bulluck and fumbled, with Tennessee recovering. However, two plays later, the Jets would get the ball right back, as Collins, inserted back into the game, was intercepted by Dyson, his second of the quarter. Setting up shop at the Titans' 36-yard line, the Jets would capitalize, as Pennington threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery with 18 seconds left in the first half, but kicker Mike Nugent shanked the extra-point attempt wide right to leave the Jets with a 13-0 halftime lead. Tennessee's woes in the passing game continued as soon as the second half started, with Collins getting intercepted again, this time by Kerry Rhodes, who returned the ball 25 yards to the Tennessee 22. Nugent nailed an 18-yard field goal as the drive stalled at the one-yard line. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington drove to the red zone again, but Nugent missed a 34-yard field goal attempt wide right. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington appeared to find Cotchery on a 2-yard touchdown pass, but the touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on D'Brickashaw Ferguson. When the drive stalled, Nugent missed another field goal, hitting the right upright from 30 yards out. Tennessee finally capitalized, with Travis Henry scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run with 10:48 left in the game. Tennessee went for two, and brought in Young. Young's pass intended for Bobby Wade was incomplete, but Jets defensive back Derrick Strait was flagged for pass interference, giving the Titans second life. They would take advantage, with Collins handing off to Henry for the conversion. After a trade of punts, the Jets took over on their own 11 with 7:28 to go. On third down, Pennington was sacked by Cortland Finnegan, and Tennessee's Randy Starks recovered at New York's 1-yard line. Tennessee went for two and converted, with Collins finding Drew Bennett open, and the game was tied, 16-16. The Jets came right back, first with Justin Miller returning the ensuing kickoff 41 yards, and then Pennington steadily driving downfield, finding Baker on the 12-yard touchdown pass to cap a 7-play, 57-yard drive. The Jets had to hold on because on the next possession, Collins found Bennett on a 26-yard completion moving the ball to midfield, and he then completed long passes to Ben Troupe and Wade to move the ball to the Jets' 12-yard line with 1:11 to play. The Jets locked down, and on 4th-and-6 from the Jets' 8-yard line, Collins' pass for Bo Scaife was knocked away by Rhodes, ending the game.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Which quarterback got pulled

In the second quarter, the Raiders got on the board with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 38-yard field goal.  However, Denver continued to pound away as RB Cecil Sapp got a 4-yard TD run, while kicker Jason Elam got a 23-yard field goal.

In the fourth quarter, the Raiders took the lead as DT Gerard Warren sacked Cutler in the end zone for a safety, while LB Thomas Howard returned an interception 44 yards for a touchdown (followed by a successful two-point conversion pass from McCown to WR Ronald Curry).  However, the Broncos tied the game up with Elam's 20-yard field goal.  In overtime, Oakland managed to make Denver go three-and-out on their first possession.  A 33-yard run by RB LaMont Jordan helped set up Janikowski for a game-winning 52-yard field goal. Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan called timeout before the kick could begin.  Janikowski's second try hit off the very tip of the left goal post and was no good, giving Denver a chance to win the game.  The Broncos won with Elam getting a 23-yard field goal.

The Ravens' defense was strong, limiting the running game to just 9 yards on the first 8 attempts, with constant blitz pressure forcing Browns QB Josh McCown to make the right reads on his passes. The Ravens led 14-3 after the first quarter and 21-9 early in the third quarter.  At that point, the Browns began to come back.  The Browns scored a touchdown to make it 21-16 heading into the 4th quarter.  Connecting with TE Gary Barnidge on an 80-yd drive in the fourth quarter, the Browns led for the first time at 22-21. Teams then traded scores, with the Ravens leading 27-22, then the Browns leading 30-27 with three minutes left in regulation.  The Ravens used those three minutes to drive down the field and tie the game with a field goal. Tied at 30 after regulation, the game headed into overtime. The Ravens got the ball first. The Browns' defense forced a 3-and-out, and Travis Benjamin set up the punt at the Brown's 35. The Ravens failed to force a punt or turnover as the Browns drove down the field to the Ravens' 14 yard line, where K Travis Coons would kick the game-winning field goal . McCown completed passes to nine different receivers; four of them&#8212;Gary Barnidge, Travis Benjamin, Andrew Hawkins and Taylor Gabriel&#8212;had six or more receptions. He finished 36/51 for a career-high 457 yards with two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown. McCown also became the first quarterback in franchise history to throw 300+ passing yards in three straight games.  The Browns ran the ball 25 times, with seven carries in overtime to set up the game-winning field goal by Coons, who is now 10-for-10 to start his career. With the win, the Browns improved to 2-3 and moved into 3rd place in the AFC North.  The Browns snapped a five-game road losing streak and a seven-game losing streak in Baltimore.  This was also the Browns' first overtime win since November 18, 2007, coincidentally a 33-30 road victory over the Ravens in the infamous \"Dawson Bar\" Game.

However, after each team traded punts, the Broncos staged a rally with just over five minutes remaining, with quarterback Tim Tebow throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas to pull to within 15-7 with 2:44 remaining. After the Broncos recovered an onside kick, they subsequently marched down the field, with Tebow connecting on a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Fells, followed by Tebow scrambling for the two-point conversion to send the game into overtime.

Four plays later, kicker Matt Prater, who had missed two field goals in the first half, nailed the game-winning 52-yard field goal.

This backfired when the Redskins running back Quinton Ganther recovered the kick and returned it 25 yards to the Eagles 24-yard line. Four plays later, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell ran for a two-yard touchdown to score the game's first touchdown, as the Redskins took the lead 7-0. After a holding penalty on Eagles tight end Brent Celek, the Eagles had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker David Akers. On the following drive by the Eagles, quarterback Donovan McNabb found wide receiver DeSean Jackson wide open in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown to bring the Eagles up 10-7. On the ensuing drive by the Redskins, Campbell threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss to take the lead 14-10. Late in the second quarter, after both teams punting the ball away after three unsuccessful drives, Eagles cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a Jason Campbell pass that was intended for Santana Moss. The Eagles could not convert a third down with 10 to go, and David Akers kicked a 24-yard field goal to get the Eagles within a point of the Redskins, 14-13. The Redskins received the ball again and Campbell threw a second straight interception to Samuel, who returned it for 17 yards. The Eagles ended the first half with a second straight field goal to take the lead 16-14. The Eagles got the ball to start the second half, but the drive ended with a Sav Rocca punt. Jason Campbell threw a 10-yard touchdown to tight end Fred Davis to take the lead once again, 21-16. After two straight punts for each team, the Eagles got the ball back in the fourth quarter and Donovan McNabb threw an intended pass to Reggie Brown, but the pass was intercepted by Redskins cornerback Justin Tryon. The Redskins scored on a 25-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham, to increase their lead 24-16. The Eagles started their drive on their own 10-yard line after a penalty on the kick return by Dimitri Patterson. The Eagles went 90 yards to score on an Eldra Buckley one-yard touchdown run. Since they were losing by two points, the Eagles decided to go for a two-point conversion. The two-point conversion was successful after rookie running back LeSean McCoy ran in the end zone on a shovel pass from McNabb. The score was tied, 24-24. The Redskins could not score on the next drive, and therefore had to punt to the Eagles. The Eagles scored on a 32-yard field goal by David Akers to take the lead, 27-24.

This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal. With 2:05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22-20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history. The field goal was Gould's eleventh career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games. The win would be the only home win for the Bears all season, finishing the year with a horrific 1-7 home record.

the Colts faced their AFC South rival, the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Colts opened the game on offense and put together a twelve play, 50-yard drive that ended in an Adam Vinatieri field goal, giving the Colts an early 3-0 lead. Following a three and out forced by the Colts defense, Andrew Luck again drove the offense down the field, this time scoring on a touchdown throw Ahmad Bradshaw, extending the Colts' lead to 10-0 at the end of the first quarter. The Colts again extended their lead early in the second quarter on a pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. The Jaguars were again stopped by the Colts defense on their next offensive possession, with the Colts defense preventing the Jaguars for converting a first down on their first three possessions. The Colts' offense, though they would deep into Jaguars' territory, were forced to settle for Vinatieri field goals on their next two offensive possessions, giving them a 23-0 lead. After a fumble recovery by Darius Butler late in the first half, they were set up with good field position in Jaguars territory. A Luck touchdown pass to Coby Fleener extended the Colts' lead to 30-0 at halftime. After struggling to move the ball in the first half, the Jaguars replaced quarterback Chad Henne with rookie Blake Bortles. The Jaguars were able to convert a first down on their first drive of the half, though they were forced to punt following a penalty that sent them back to midfield. On the Jaguars' next possession, they again drove into Colts' territory, enough to get their first points of the game on a 41-yard field goal from Josh Scobee. At the end of the third quarter, the Colts continued to hold a commanding 30-3 lead. The Colts scored their first points of the second half on a pass from Luck to Hakeem Nicks early in the fourth quarter. Bortles threw his first career touchdown pass on the Jaguars' next possession, throwing it to Allen Hurns. With the large lead late in the game, the Colts replaced Luck with backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. Late in the fourth quarter the Colts defense extended the lead, with an interception returned for a touchdown by Greg Toler. A Bortles pass to Cecil Shorts III was the last scoring play of the game, giving the Colts the 44-17 win. At the end of the game, Andrew Luck completed 31 of 39 pass attempts for 370 yards and four touchdown passes, which earned him the honor of AFC Offensive Player of the Week.

traveled to Lucas Oil Stadium for an AFC duel with the Indianapolis Colts. The Broncos grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting with wide receiver Eric Decker on a 17-yard touchdown pass. The Colts responded, with a 27-yard field goal by placekicker Adam Vinatieri. Following a fumble by Broncos' return specialist Trindon Holliday on a punt return, the Colts grabbed the lead, with quarterback Andrew Luck completing an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey. The Broncos re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with Manning throwing a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas. On the Broncos next possession, Colts' linebacker Robert Mathis forced a fumble off Manning out of the end zone, resulting in a safety. The Colts subsequently re-claimed the lead, with Luck connecting on a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback Stanley Havili, then added to their lead, with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Luck to tight end Coby Fleener just before halftime. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their first three possessions of the third quarter, and the Colts took a 33-14 lead, with Luck rushing for a 10-yard touchdown. Late in the third quarter, the Broncos tried to cut into the Colts lead, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but the Colts responded early in the fourth quarter, with a 52-yard field goal by Vinatieri. Trailing 36-17, the Broncos attempted a rally, with Manning connecting on a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Knowshon Moreno. The latter score occurred after Broncos' safety Duke Ihenacho forced a fumble off Colts' running back Trent Richardson deep in Colts' territory. The Broncos' defense forced a punt on the Colts next possession. However, with 7:07 remaining in the fourth quarter, Manning's arm was hit by Colts' linebacker Erik Walden, and his pass was subsequently intercepted by linebacker Pat Angerer deep in Broncos' territory. Four plays later, a Vinatieri 42-yard field goal gave the Colts a 39-30 lead with 6:06 remaining. Eight plays into the Broncos' next possession, running back Ronnie Hillman lost a fumble at the Colts' 3-yard line at the 3:15 mark of the fourth quarter, just as the Broncos were attempting to narrow the Colts' lead. The Colts' offense subsequently ran time off the clock, forcing the Broncos to burn all three of their team timeouts. The Broncos tried a desperation rally with 1:28 remaining, with Prater nailing a 47-yard field goal with only 17 seconds remaining. However, the ensuing onside kick was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Colts. With the loss, the Broncos' 17-game regular season winning streak was snapped. This marked Peyton Manning's first visit to Indianapolis since he was released by the Colts in March 2012.

Prior to the season, NFL analysts rated this rivalry as the top upcoming rivalry, as well as the top rivalry of the decade. Both teams proved that point, when they had an arms race in the off-season, Seattle picking up Percy Harvin and San Francisco picking Anquan Boldin in the off-season, among others. Last season, the teams were 1-1 against each other, Seattle being the better team, as they blew out the Niners 42-13 in the last meeting in Seattle, coincidentally, also on Sunday Night Football. It was also a day that Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick appeared to bet an eyebrow, with the loser shaving his eyebrow; this was later revealed to be a publicity stunt. Finally, it was a day where former Seahawk Shaun Alexander would raise the 12th man flag. The game began quietly though, as both sides failed to establish a rhythm. The game was delayed midway through the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, the second such case in the 2013 season (Ravens-Broncos kickoff game in week 1 was the first). After getting back onto the field, the 49ers blocked a Seahawks punt and got the ball in Seattle territory. However, Seattle claimed a whistle was heard from the crowd, which confused the linemen and the punter. That claim was later justified by NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth. The Niners took advantage and drove to the Seattle 10-yard line. However, on third down, Earl Thomas intercepted a Colin Kaepernick pass, and Seattle regained possession. A few plays later, Russell Wilson was intercepted by rookie Eric Reid, and the tug of war continued into the second quarter. All was quiet until midway through the second quarter, where fullback Bruce Miller was caught holding in the endzone, the result of which was a safety, and a Seattle 2-0 lead. Later on, defensive end Cliff Avril strip sacked Kaepernick and K. J. Wright recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a Steven Hauschka 30-yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5-0 Seahawks lead. The game was pretty dark and messy at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch. In the third quarter, the Seahawks came out roaring. On third and 12, Wilson connected with receiver Doug Baldwin for a 51-yard gain to inside the 49ers 25 yard line. A few plays later, Lynch took it to the house on a 14-yard run, 12-0 Seattle. The 49ers responded with a drive to the Seattle 6-yard line, capped of by Phil Dawson 21-yard field goal, that included a 28-yard scramble by Kaepernick, 12-3 Seahawks. However, that would be it for the Niners, and the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks demolished the Niners on all phases of play. It started with Wilson hitting Lynch for a 7-yard score on third down. A few plays into the Niners next drive, Kaepernick was intercepted by Richard Sherman, who took it to the 49ers 25-yard line. That resulted in a 37-yard Steven Hauschka field goal. On the ensuing Niners drive, Kaepernick was intercepted again, this time by safety Kam Chancellor, who had signed a contract extension earlier in the year. Lynch scored on a 2-yard run on the next play. Seattle led 29-3. The 49ers fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Seattle recovered. Seattle won, in convincing style, silencing any critics. The 12th man also broke a Guinness world record, for the loudest outdoor stadium. Yet again, Seattle dominated on SNF, and Pete Carroll improved to 3-4 overall against the Niners, and 2-3 against bitter rival Jim Harbaugh. Seattle was now 2-0, and still unbeaten at home.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many interceptions were there in the first quarter?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "",

the Tennessee Titans. It also marked the second consecutive year that the Raiders began the season on the road. On September 9, one day before the first game of the season, the Raiders placed Sebastian Janikowski on injured reserve due to an injured back. They signed Giorgio Tavecchio off the practice squad to do the kicking. The Raiders started well as the Titans tried to surprise the Raiders with an onside kick on the opening kickoff which the Raiders recovered. Four plays later, Derek Carr hit Amari Cooper who bowled into the endzone for an eight-yard touchdown pass to give the Raiders the lead 7-0. The Titans answered on their ensuing drive, going 75 yards on 12 plays with Marcus Mariota rushing for a 10-yard touchdown to tie the game. The Raiders came back as Tavecchio hit his first career field goal, a 20-yarder, to give the Raiders a 10-7 lead. After exchanging punts in the early part of the second quarter, the Titans tied the game with 43 seconds remaining in the half on a Ryan Succop 23-yard field goal. The Raider offense moved 41 yards with time winding down to set up Tavecchio's second field goal, from 52 yards out, to give the Raiders the halftime lead 13-10. In the second half, the Raider defense held the Titans to punts on consecutive drives as the Raiders notched another 52-yard field goal to extend the lead to 16-10 with a little over four minutes left in the third period. The Raider defense prevented a Titans touchdown on the ensuing drive, forcing the Titans to settle for a 26-yard field goal which narrowed the gap to 16-13 as the period expired. In the fourth quarter, Carr led the Raiders on a seven play, 70-yard drive capped off by a Seth Roberts 19-yard touchdown reception. The Raiders defense, which had struggled immensely the previous year, forced the Titans to punt and then held them to a field goal with 4:49 remaining. Another Tavecchio field goal, this time from 43 yards out, extended the lead to 26-16 with 1:14 left in the game. The Titans could muster no more, missing a 52-yard field goal with 12 seconds remaining as the Raiders pulled out the win 26-16.

A 6-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Wes Welker gave the Broncos the early lead. The Eagles countered, with a 35-yard field goal by placekicker Alex Henery, however, the Broncos subsequently increased their lead, with return specialist Trindon Holliday returning the ensuing kickoff 105 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles cut into the Broncos' lead in the second quarter, with a 25-yard field goal by Henery, followed by running back Chris Polk rushing for a 4-yard touchdown to pull to within 14-13. However, the Broncos proceeded to score 38 unanswered points and take control of the game. First, running back Knowshon Moreno rushed for a 4-yard touchdown. Then in the third quarter, Manning added three more touchdown passes &#8212; a 1-yarder and a 15-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, followed by a 4-yarder to Welker. In the fourth quarter, Broncos' linebacker Steven Johnson blocked Donnie Jones' punt and immediately returned the football 17 yards for a touchdown, which was followed by a 53-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Eagles scored a late touchdown, with quarterback Nick Foles, playing in place of Michael Vick, completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeff Maehl, but the outcome of the game had already been decided in the Broncos' favor. Former offensive lineman Tom Nalen, who played with the Broncos from 1994-2007, was inducted to the Broncos Ring of Fame during halftime. Nalen made it to five Pro Bowls, earning the NFL's Offensive Lineman of the Year award in 2003, and was an integral part of 11 seasons in which the Broncos had at least one running back rush for 1,000 yards within a season.

The Raiders Pro Bowl long snapper Jon Condo suffered a head injury in the second quarter. He was replaced by linebacker Travis Goethel, who had not snapped since high school. Goethel rolled two snaps to punter Shane Lechler, each giving the Chargers the ball in Raiders territory, and Lechler had another punt blocked by Dante Rosario. The Chargers scored their only touchdown in the second quarter after a 13-play, 90-yard drive resulted in a 6-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to wide receiver Malcom Floyd. The Chargers failed to score four out of five times in the red zone. San Diego led at halftime 10-6, and the Raiders did not scored a touchdown until 54 seconds remained in the game. Undrafted rookie Mike Harris made his first NFL start, filing in for left tackle for an injured Jared Gaither. San Diego protected Harris by having Rivers throw short passes; sixteen of Rivers' 24 completions were to running backs and tight ends, and he threw for 231 yards while only being sacked once.

Buccaneers running back Earnest Graham was a part of the starting lineup for the first time in his career, replacing the injured Michael Pittman, who sat out the game. The first half was a defensive struggle, with neither team scoring in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Tennessee drove to the Buccaneers 32-yard line, but quarterback Vince Young fumbled the ball and the Buccaneers recovered. Jeff Garcia connected on a 39-yard pass play to Michael Clayton, to help set up a 23-yard Matt Bryant field goal, the first points of the game. Moments later, Phillip Buchanon intercepted Vince Young with 1:29 remaining in the half, to maintain a 3-0 halftime lead. Tennessee took the second half kickoff, and executed a 12-play, 45-yard drive which resulted in a 48-yard field goal by Rob Bironas. On their next possession, Vince Young ran out of bounds, and suffered a strained quad. He would have to leave the game, and was replaced by Kerry Collins. On Tampa Bay's next drive, Garcia connected with Joey Galloway for a 69-yard touchdown catch. On the ensuing drive Ronde Barber intercepted a pass by Kerry Collins, but it ruled incomplete after review. With less than four minutes remaining in regulation, Collins drove the Titans to the Buccaneers 23-yard line. For the second time, Ronde Barber intercepted Collins, this time in the endzone, but it was again ruled incomplete after review. The drive continued, and with 1:24 remaining, LenDale White tied the game 10-10 with a touchdown run. With only one timeout, Garcia drove the Buccaneers 55 yards on seven plays. With 11 seconds remaining, Matt Bryant kicked a game-winning 43-yard field goal.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Which team scored the first points of the game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day":

Week 16 rematch to conclude the 40th season of Monday Night Football. Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. The Vikings started out the quarter's scoring with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal, along with Adrian Peterson's second 1-yard TD run. The Bears then responded with Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett. The Vikings then completed the remarkable comeback with Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 6-yard TD pass on 4th-and-goal with 15 seconds left in regulation. The Bears then took a knee to force overtime. In overtime, the Bears won the toss and marched down the field, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, the potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt by Gould went wide right, giving the Vikings a chance to win. After an exchange of punts, the Vikings had the ball at the 26-yard line with 11 minutes left in the period. On the first play of scrimmage, Favre fired a screen pass to Peterson who caught it and went 16 yards, before being confronted by Hunter Hillenmeyer, who caused Peterson to fumble the ball, which was then recovered by Bears' linebacker Nick Roach. The Bears then won on Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu.

the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their \"Wildcat\" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the \"Wildcat\" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots

In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 56-yard and a 25-yard field goal. Chiefs quarterback Damon Huard suffered a neck injury in the first quarter and Tyler Thigpen substituted as quarterback for the remainder of the game. Huard was in for Kansas City's first two series, but didn't return after throwing an interception late in the second quarter. Marques Hagans, who was listed on the Chiefs' roster as a wide receiver, checked in as quarterback for several draw plays. The Chiefs announced at the end of the third quarter that Huard sustained \"mild head trauma,\" a move deemed controversial as Huard never sought medical attention in the following days. Under Thigpen, the Chiefs' offense struggled to move the ball down the field. In using three quarterbacks, the Chiefs had only 65 net yards at halftime. Raiders RB Darren McFadden got a 19-yard TD run in the third quarter. Oakland increased its lead with Janikowski nailing a 40-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. The Chiefs would respond with rookie QB Tyler Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, Kansas City executed a two-point conversion pass to rookie FB Mike Cox to make them within 8 points with just over five minutes remaining. The Chiefs' two-point conversion was the team's first in two years. Kansas City lost its opportunity to tie the game as the Raiders pulled away with RB Michael Bush getting a 32-yard TD run. The Chiefs' defense allowed the third-highest total yards on offense in franchise history. JaMarcus Russell completed only 6 of 17 passes for 55&#160;yards and led the Raiders to a 15-point victory. Following the game, Chiefs RB Larry Johnson voiced his displeasure with the Chiefs' offense and his role with the team. With the loss, the Chiefs fell to an 0-2 record for the third consecutive year.
